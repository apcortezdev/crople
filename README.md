# crople

This is a React Native project created as a portfolio for the developer. Please feel free to get in touch with him with your questions.
This is a simple game where you have to crop a ball as many times as you can. The more times you crop the ball the more points you make.
In order to crop the ball many times you have to crop in very small pieces, and that's where the challenge is.
